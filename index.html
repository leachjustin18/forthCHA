                Tatum delivered her infant daughter, Piper, at 28 weeks. Piper was immediately admitted to the NICU. 
                Tatum is emotional and worried not only about her own recovery, but the care of her daughter.  
                Appropriate interventions to assist her and other parents include:

                        <li>Take the parents on a tour of the unit, or link to other resources (video or web site) 
                        	when not possible.</li>
                        <li>Provide booklets to the family which describes the NICU and the professionals involved in 
                        	their infant's care.</li>
                        <li>Create a welcoming and warm unit environment.</li>
                        <li>Do not overwhelm the parents with details during the initial visit to the ICU. The parents 
                            will appreciate and require detailed information at a later time.</li>

                Staffing changes, monitors and equipment, and the deluge of medical information can be overwhelming to

                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide families with the names of the staff members providing care to their child.</li>

                        <li>Provide consistent caregivers whenever possible.</li>
                        <li>Be consistent with the information given to parents.</li>
                        <li>Arrange for family meetings between family and staff members (e.g., physicians, nurses, 
                            social worker and chaplain).</li>
                        <li>Provide continuous updates and information related to the infant's condition via phone or 
                            directly. Provide the parents a toll&ndash;free number to make long&ndash;distance calls to 
                            the ICU, if available. If the family does not have a phone due to financial issues, consult
