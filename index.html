     With a sick child, siblings also experience stress and suffer a wide range of feelings, thoughts and reactions.

<ul>
<li>Siblings may feel left out as parents spend time at the hospital or they may worry that they too will get sick.</li>
<li>Siblings may feel they are to blame and their jealous feelings toward the new sibling may be the cause of tragedy.</li> 
<li>Siblings may believe their bad behavior may be causing their parents' obvious distress.</li>
<li>Siblings may also show resentment toward their parents at the perceived loss of attention.</li>
</ul>
Depending upon the child's age, the sibling will use various coping mechanisms to deal with his or her stress. Regression and acting out are not uncommon. Encourage the parents to discuss how the siblings are reacting and coping with the family crisis and provide referral to social services and family support groups as appropriate. <em>Click each question mark to see characteristics of a child's developmental level and ageâ€“appropriate interventions..</em>
